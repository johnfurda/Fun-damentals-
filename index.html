		<h2>My Mission</h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is John Furda. I'm a web devloper and graphic designer. I'm intrested in building web sites that work great in all platforms.  There is a major shift occuring in the types of devices people use to surf the internet; approximately 70% of people now use smart phones, tablets, and gaming systems instead of laptop or desktop computers. There is an increased need to build websites that function in these platforms as well as on the traditional computer. I use First Mobile Responsive Web Design, HTML, CSS, and Java Script to build websites and apps that function on all web devices and browsers and display content in a clear manner.  I utilize my love of art and design to make websites to suit each client individually . Take a look at my portfolio and contact me if you're intrested in building a great running and great looking web site.</p>
